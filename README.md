## 📌 About

This repository contains **foundational material** for learning Machine Learning (ML).  
It is designed for beginners, students, and anyone who wants to understand **how Machine Learning works**, what the key concepts are, and how to get started with basic ML projects.

Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each scenario, which is at the heart of modern AI systems. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
